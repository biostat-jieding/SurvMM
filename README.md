This is an R package for analyzing heterogeneous **Surv**ival data based on finite **M**ixture **M**odels.

*We are still in preparing this R package. Please wait patiently. Thank you for your attention!*

***The key tasks should include***: 
- Fit a mixture model with each component being a **parametric** heteroscedastic regression models.
- Fit a mixture model with each component being a **nonparametric** heteroscedastic regression models.
- Test their goodness-of-fit.
